# Mathprofi
It had to be full Mathprofi.ru rework, but something went wrong...

Once I studied in university, I used mathprofi a lot, and once I started practicing web development, I asked myself, what my first project will be ? It appeared that Mathprofi was the perfect guinea pig. Until I found out that I have to copy over 1000+ formulas for that. And since that time I have only main page with some Figma 
canvas. Enjoy !
